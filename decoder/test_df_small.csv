You may not apprehend it because people or critters look the same as cherished ones or beloved creatures! Something may go wrong in the making and in a second the feeling of the person or creature could change (Clones don't have emotions! They are like robots!) and maybe someday clones will overtake our atmosphere! It may seem pretty absurd what I am transcribing, but I can assure you to be in my faction! To say that cloning is immoral and that we should discover an innovative way to help people exist longer with natural resources and 'human' elements! For one, there are health perils going into this manner! There are also emotional risks and there could be undiscovered consequences. There could be a mutation of a human's body and a canine's head! It could happen! Another reason that cloning is dangerous is because there will be too many people on earth! Clones can not depart unless killed. The administration would not have enough funds to maintain all of these people! Another large reason to not consider cloning is because clones do not care about religion! Consider it or not, we all have a religion even if you think that you don't! If you were a clone, you could probably not have children! They can not make a clone have the same parts as a natural human being! Clones are manufactured! The whole process messes with our ecosystem! These are the reasons that cloning should not follow!

"I see no reason why these people should not be allowed to protest. Everyone should have a right to have let their opinion be known. If we selectively choose what people can say, then how is there really any free speech. And while I understand that you want the debate to about morals, it's hard to talk about what is clearly a free speech issue without bringing the government in. But I will try my best. I think that the crux of the matter is your definition of morals. You have decided that it is immoral for these to people to picket the funeral. Why? What basis do you have for this claim? The people who protest often feel that it is their moral obligation to do so. The members of the Westboro Baptist Church are trying to draw attention to what they perceive to be the moral deficiencies of the rest of the nation. Thus, they feel that they are morally justified in what they are doing. And who exactly made you the decider of what is moral and what is not? Morals are all relative to the individual; what you perceive as morally wrong they perceive as morally correct. Think of it this way: would it be right for me (a Jew) to proclaim that all Christians are immoral because they believe that Jesus was the son of God? I think that an unbiased observer would say that it isn't right. Just because I disagree with their morals doesn't make them immoral. In conclusion, although we can use our own morals to judge others, we have no right to objectively and definitively say that we are right and someone else is wrong. No one has given us this power. Furthermore, the idea of freedom of speech and expression is worthless if we decide that only some people have a right to it.",premise,pro,,unknown,unknown

"To conclude this debate I will respond to the individual points that you have mentioned, as well as supply a final recount of various reasons why the United States should not be involved with a war in Iraq. First, I disagree that the United States was attacked because of our supposed religion. I do believe that many middle eastern counties see us as immoral (due to our separation of Church and State, our ""liberal"" politics and laws, American policies of expansion and severe interest in our power/economic gains, etc etc etc). However our involvement in the war only increases their negative image of us. Plus, I'm not even entirely sure that the American government didn't have anything to do with 9/11, although that's another debate entirely. The point is that terrorists attack Israel more frequently than the U.S. not because they're afraid of us... I mean, suicide bombings mean that they're going to die anyway, so what the Hell are they afraid of?! Instead, I argue that attacks on Israel occur more frequently because 1) the proximity of middle eastern countries (and the terrorists within them) to Israel and, 2) the long-standing conflict with Israel since its inception (because of it's Holy Land). You mentioned that America is seen as the police force of the world. My rebuttal is that being considered a police force of the world may not be a good thing at all. First, perhaps our policing has helped contribute to the perception of the United States as the Evil Empire, and one reason why many terrorists groups hate us in the first place. Second, there is an extremely limited number of countries in the world (especially the United Nations) that agree with us embarking on this war. Thus, we are not seen as do-gooders helping to SAVE people, but rather ""bad cops"" (since you used the analogy of policing) who are using our powers for evil or for our own selfish agendas. We are alienating our allies one by one, including powerful ones in the middle east -- how is that benefitting our country at all? And in response to our so-called ""responsibility"" to countries with people who don't have our exact freedoms, my question is: Is war really the answer? There wasn't a better way? As a result of this war, countless soldiers and civilians have died, not to mention the entire American economy is in shambles. We have so many debts to foreign nations; again this is a HORRIBLE move politics wise. But in terms of moral obligation, I pose the question- Who are we to determine what rights and freedoms other countries should have? After all, Holland has had marijuana legalized for years, whereas it is not legal in the United States. Is Holland giving us a hard time about it? No. Countries in Europe have also legalized gay marriage YEARS before the United States even considered it. Are they telling us what to do and how to run our country? No. Granted these things may all seem trivial to the torture imposed upon Iraqi civilians under Saddam Hussein. However are we forgetting the torture that America has imposed upon its own citizens in the past? Slavery anyone? The Civil Rights Movement? Being attacked by German Shepards and bludgeoned to death by police officers for fighting to sit at the front of the bus hardly seems humane to me. Yet other countries did not impose upon our affairs. Likewise there are countless instances in American society where as a nation we have acted cruel and unfairly (I won't get into that). The point is that most countries see international war as a last resort, and is considered just only in dire circumstances, such as if your country is put in severe danger. Our country was attacked, yes. But not by Iraq. By the Taliban; al Queda. Fight THEM. Continue the war against TERRORISM. But no, you cannot just go to war with known countries that house terrorists. Because guess what - the U.S. houses them too. And while certain countries may come off as 'potential threats' due to that fact, just imagine about how much of a threat the United States appears to be since we 1) apparently find it within our right to police the world and go to war despite the support of the United Nations, and 2) we proudly boast about our WMDs even though we are hypocritical enough to invade countries because of the possibility that other nations may have them. Even if Iraq DID have WMDs (which they did not... and we were lied to about it repeatedly), why are they more of a threat then the United States who has proven that we will attack a country randomly for whatever reason? Bottom line: Other countries (even enemies) have WMDs. We do not attack them because they pose more of a threat to the U.S. than Iraq did. Iraq was a relatively easy target; it's not right of the U.S. to use its military prowess to infringe upon the rights of an inferior country. We wouldn't want people telling us how to run our country, yet we are that egotistical that we have that right over others? I'm sure that many people in other nations would feel that the Death Penalty and killing someone via electric chair is inhumane. But that is for the American people and the American government to decide. Imagine war being declared upon us, and American civilians dying in the streets because people of other cultures disagreed with our laws and way of life. Middle-eastern culture is completely different from ours; cultures change and evolve at their own pace over time constantly. Why don't you look up ancient Roman practices and other cultural behavioral patterns from the past and then come talk to me about history. And finally, I'll recount my reasons + add some new ones on why this war is wrong: the number of casualties (from all sides); the cost of this war and its effect on the American economy and policy + way of life; the negative repercussion regarding how the world views America, i.e. al Qaeda and other terrorist groups can cite this as an example of the U.S. taking over the world and our need to be stopped/punished... plus other world powers seeing America as a bully who will stop at nothing to get our way; fighting in Iraq has slowed the production of oil, causing gas prices all over the world to sky rocket and cause more economic problems for us Americans at home, etc. The list goes on and on. Like I said, there are (a FEW) legitimate reasons for the United States to be at war with Iraq. However like I have mentioned in a previous round, the cons far outweigh the pros. So, I would like to thank everybody for reading, Marine_to_be for debating, and would like to ask everyone to keep in mind that regardless of your position on this issue, to please vote based on who has given the best arguments and performed better in this particular debate.

Should we believe in God,claim,pro,**,unknown,unknown
"My opponent has seemed to veer completely off track. Almost all of his last argument was devoted to showing why he thinks God is evil. As much as I would love to debate that, I must adhere to the resolution at hand. Thus far, my opponent has given no solid evidence as to why you should not believe in God. As the instigator, he has completely blown off his burden of proof. ""First I will say the miracles performed by Jesus in the new testament also break the laws of physics but you still choose to believe this man did them even though it is impossible."" You seem to have missed my last point. These things are impossible through natural means. Therefore, a supernatural entity is necessary. Jesus was not an ordinary human bound by the laws of physics. ""Ok how was god created if matter can not be created then it means that he couldn't have been created to create matter and if matter cannot be created how did he create it so how can he exist."" Again, He is not bound by the natural laws of science, since He created them. (And everything else on this Earth for that matter) Much like a cartoonist binds his artwork to the page, so has God bound us with physics. God can (and obviously has) create(d) matter because He is not physically bound. ""Also if the universe needs a cause then why doesn't god need a cause[sic]"" I'll take the hit for an ad-hominum. You really aren't getting the idea here are you? As your Richard Dawkins will tell you, matter does not spontaneously burst into being. He will also tell you that he knows that he exists, and has matter. We can then deduce that his matter did not spontaneously burst into being because it is physically impossible. Mr. Dawkins will then tell you that he doesn't know how the universe started, but that he knows what kind of event must have taken place. (See previously posted video) When asked if God is a possibility, he says that he cannot prove that God doesn't exist, simply because God is non-falsifiable. This is true. However, he still leaves a gaping unanswered question of how matter came into existence. Physically, it is impossible. I should not exist, you should not exist, and even the great Richard Dawkins should not exist. Funny story though, he exists. So do you, and so do I. If we exist, and we could not have gotten here by natural means, then we must have arrived by something greater than natural means. Could the answer possibly be a....... supernatural being? God? Until my opponent can provide me with a valid alternative answer, he has no case. I therefore rest mine. The resolution remains affirmed.",premise,pro,,unknown,unknown

Of course I don't think halloween it this great threat to society, but I think we should just drop the pagan stuff. I mean some people so believe in ""magic"" and have dark magic ""cults"" where people do actually get hurt. Like it is now halloween make these things seem a little more acceptable. It makes children more eager to try it out, just in case they are a wizard. Also, dropping the pagan ties we allow children from religious families to join in in the fun. I know some of them do, but halloween is against most religions and I know atheists will say that if ""dumb religious people"" don't want to join in we don't need to change it for them, but those children did not chose in which families they were born into and it just causes conflict for them. In conclusion, I think we should not celebrate halloween and that we can just create a new holiday which is essentially the same without the pagan and religious ties.

"I still don't fully understand the topic, but I will continue to debate. Sadly, my opponent has wasted a round and he has not presented any arguments or stated his stance. So, I will be assuming the stance that we should mandatorily study geography and history. In order to get my point across, I would like to present one reason each why the studies of geography and history are both important. First off is geography. Argument 1: We should study geography because it helps in the modern world when students grow up. For example, many people in today's world do not know where basic states and countries are. For example, in the video that can be found at , Harvard students were interviewed and asked what the capital of Canada was, and none of them knew. Also, in this video titled ""Why we need to teach geography"", () 8th and 12th graders were given geography assessments. 74% of 8th graders had a basic geography understanding, and only 24% had a proficient geography understanding, while a mere 3% had an advanced level geography understanding. And in 12th grade, the percentages were even lower. In the same video, Americans were asked simple geography questions that they could not answer. This is impactful because it shows that we need to stress teaching geography and history in schools. Next, history. Argument 2: We should study history because, once again, it helps with understanding of the world, especially with government officials. You know that little kid who lives down the street? He could grow up to be the next president, or congressman, or even mayor, but he was never taught history, so he has no idea how a government is run, let alone how to run his own. He influences higher individuals (if he isn't president) in his wrong running ways, and tears the country into shreds. If this isn't a strong enough example for you, watch the video linked here, . This video shows Americans asked why we celebrate the 4th of July, and, no surprise, they simply could not answer it. This is impactful because this argument shows how we need geography. Since I have now shown why both history and geography are vital to be taught, I believe I have won this debate. So, a message to all voters: vote for me!

"I think that there has been a miscommunication. You seem to think that I am arguing for forcing these people to accept Western culture. But I am not. I meant to make that clear when I said that western culture is not necessarily the best thing, so we shouldn't compel them to live like us. All I am arguing for is spreading the gospel. But you seem to think that they have already heard. As proof you say that their ancestors had to have been told at some time in history. This may be true, I do not know. But what I do know is that that doesn't mean that this generation has heard. They need a chance too. But would they even consider exchanging their religion for Christianity? Would I accept a belief that Aliens told me about? (I do not accept the ""not scientific""proof"" part.) No, I would not. But in the past, tribes have changed. Look at the Huaroni, for example. So it may be that they will change, and it would be wrong to refuse them the chance. But should we get involved in other nations issues? Let me put it this way. You have a dog in your house which you force to stay inside. It has no idea that there is a world outside. If I come and give it walks, would that be wrong? You would probably say yes because it is your dog, not mine. You'd say that you should be able to do what you want with it. But these are people, not dogs, and that makes a very big difference. If you were to keep your daughter inside like that, she would most likely be taken away from you. Yes, I have read ""To Kill a Mockingbird."" In it it spoke of harming and cruely treating innocent men. I am proposing doing the opposite. I say we should treat these people like we would want to be treated, not forcing them to stay in their cage of ignorance, not keeping them in the dark. How is that ""potentially harming them""""? The only example you found was westernizing them. But what I have been proposing is giving them Jesus, medicine, food, shelter, and anything else they need.

Should we continue the practice of solitary confinement in the United States criminal justice system,claim,con,Claim: Solitary confinement should be abolished in the United States criminal justice system.Premise: Solitary confinement is a form of punishment that is used in the United States criminal justice system. It is used to punish inmates who have committed serious crimes. The purpose of solitary confinement is to keep the inmate from harming themselves or others. The purpose of solitary confinement is to keep the inmate from,claim,con
"1. I agree with the definition of solitary confinement; however, I would also like to add that they are allowed to see/interact with prison guards.2. If a person is placed into solitary confinement, then they will be properly disciplined. 3. Solitary confinement is not entirely immoral nor is it unethical because of its intention of disciplining someone. 4. Being disciplined is good.5. All other negative consequences of solitary confinement, such as: damaged psyche, being unable to 'properly' integrate back into society, and deviating from society's norms with new mental instability, are acceptable in light of the benefits of being disciplined. 6. The eighth amendment states: “Excessive bail shall not be required, nor excessive fines imposed, nor cruel and unusual punishments inflicted.” 7. Solitary confinement cannot be considered cruel and unusual punishment because it might be harmful to one’s psyche. It is not a definite outcome of being placed into solitary confinement. 8. Regarding the statistic “…A third of the population in solitary confinement are made up of mentally ill people,” does that reflect our current time, or the past? Because in the past, prior to the eighth amendment, people that were mentally ill were considered a danger to society, so they incarcerated them. Thereafter, the ‘cruel and unusual’ part of the eighth amendment was created. If it is allowed, then it does not violate the eighth amendment. 9. I do not agree with it being a social burden. How is this a social burden if the prisoners are being placed in isolation? They are no longer a burden if they are out of sight. 10. Americans pay enough taxes on prisons and prisoners now, how is ‘fixing them in a way society can see them as able to join the free population’ going to lessen that amount? It won’t – it will only add to the massive amount of taxes each American citizen already has to pay. 11. There are other ways to integrate them back into society. For example look at a soldier returning home for war that's been diagnosed with PTSD. The mental state is clearly unstable; however, after some time they are able to socialize with society again. How? Because of their influences they have in their life. With the right motivation and incentive a person can accomplish whatever they want. 12. Forms of solitary confinement are used in every day life and work; for instance, children -- (instead of being hit) they are placed in a corner for an hour or two. These tactics are used for discipline. _________________________________________________________________________________________________ 13. Therefore, solitary confinement is necessary, and we should continue the practice of it. Non-controversial: premise 1 is stating, and adding to, the definition of solitary confinement. Premise 2 is a casual claim; therefore, it cannot be controversial. Premise 6 is what the eighth amendment states, nothing is being argued there.

Should we cut Welfare,claim,pro,,unknown,unknown
"Here is is my rebuttal: 1. My opponent says that welfare works because 80% of the people who use it usually just take 5 years to find another job. What about the other 20% that are taking this to the long term because 5 years is not a long time. By middle class life I guess opponent has not just meant the vital things needed (running water, electricity, a house, food supplies, etc.), but also several luxuries you get in middle class life. Some Americans on welfare have great housing while receiving unemployment checks at food stamps, but are abseloutly making no attempt to find a job. In fact one baker was asked by a woman to make a cake that looked like her new designer purse. When the baker told her it would cost 150 dollars she asked if he takes food stamps. 2. I do agree with my opponent that we need more stable funding and need to make sure that these people on welfare are actually looking for jobs. As for educational assistance I think that we need to send the people who need it back public schools or schools for just adults that need to look back at education. We should fund educational assistance, but make sure we have the capability to teach all these people without going over the needed capacity which would cause more government funded teachers to be around than needed. 3. What we must do is find out who and why these vendors are giving out welfare claims to people who need them. It is possible that they are just doing it so they can make themselves useful. That goes for the 93% that my opponent claimed that are abusing welfare. This is why we need more detail on the other 7% that find other ways to get welfare without needing it. In closer I have found this: ""It is morally wrong for the government to take money from people and redistribute it to those who they say are in need (i.e. more likely to vote for them). Having said that I want to emphasize that I am not against charity. Just the opposite, I believe it is the duty of every man to help out his fellow man as he is able but I am very much opposed to public welfare. Let me put it on the very personal level. If some poor fellow comes up to me in the street and asks me for some help feeding his family and getting medical help for Tiny Tim (who is a cripple), perhaps I will be moved with compassion and want to help. I would then reach into my pocket and see if I have anything there that would help. But maybe he needs a friend or a teacher and I could be that person to make a difference in his life. Maybe my efforts to restore this guy who is down on his luck could change both our lives. But the least I could do is give him a few bucks. But let's say I don't have the means or interest in helping out this guy. Is it okay for me to go to you, beat a few dollars out of you and give it to him? No, it's not. That is theft.

Where these animals should have been 100 naturally, now they are 5000 in number. Now in order to feed them and make them healthy so people can consume them, they are given the veg food and water which would have otherwise been given to the humans, and hence people in poor countries are dying because of lack of food. Statistics say that vegetarian food for 20 people = non veg food for 2 people. So, definitely you all non vegetarians are responsible for hunger and deaths in poor countries like Somalia, Congo, etc, because you all are addicted to that taste. aren't you? Please refer these and you will understand my point and explanation completely- Con quoted-""Like I said earlier, there is a big difference between a wild animal and a executed prisoner. A heard of wild Buffalo will kill you in the wild, so by your logic they are useless to society. This is a moral question, we don't eat humans because they are humans, and in a way wouldn't that like be killing them twice? Humans are humans, wild animals are wild"" Argument- 1- A heard of wild buffaloes will kill you in the wild because their mind is not as developed as humans but that doesn't mean you should kill and eat them for your food purposes. As I said they are doing their contribution to the environment. And any sane and logical man would not go into the wild without any protection, I believe con! But yes you can kill anyone to save yourself, may be an animal. No, it wouldn't be killing them twice as I said, BURYING them has many disadvantages so just eat them right? Con quoted- ""Prisoners are still humans, wild animals are not. Wild animals will try to kill you in an instant, just like a prisoner would. You wouldn't eat a human, but you would eat meat so don't be a hypocrite"" Argument- 1- I am just saying either you eat both prisoners and animals or don't eat any of them, that's it. I didn't get why you are calling me a hypocrite. I am pretty clear on my words. 2-And humans eat chicken, goat, cow, fish, camel, who knows what else. So you are saying that you are not eating any of them? 3- I am not saying that you should not eat animals, I am saying that you should not eat humans. 4- I am not saying that you should not eat humans, I am saying that you should not eat animals. 5- I am not saying that you should not eat humans, I am saying that you should not eat animals. 6- I am not saying that you should",claim,pro

"Pro has once again ignored the quantitative evidence I provided showing that the Federal Reserve has immensely benefited the stability of the American economy through its monetary policy, more than *halving* the time the country has spent in recessions. That is a huge impact, and Pro has conceded it. . 1. Pro has not provided a source to indicate that Congress's passing of the Federal Reserve Act was ""mindless"". Dismiss his baseless claim. 2. I have no obligation to go fact-finding for Pro. He made the assertion that the Fed directly caused two of the biggest economic crises in US history, so he needs to back that up with solid evidence. All he has provided so far is some theoretical mechanism by which the Fed *could* have caused those crises. Reject this argument as a bare assertion. 4. As demonstrated in the CNN article from last round, people in general do not like the idea of their tax money being used to bail out banks, yet bailing the banks out was absolutely necessary to prevent economic collapse from ensuing. What the Fed did both saved the economy and prevented an increase in public distrust of the government. It was wholly justified. 5. Richard Nixon is the one who took the US off the gold standard. Eliminating the Fed for Nixon's alleged transgression of the Constitution is completely absurd. This argument remains non-topical. 6. The source was linked at the bottom, along with my other sources. .. Pro has dropped this argument. 7. No, it's not common knowledge. I could just as easily say ""it's common knowledge that the Fed is a force for good in the economy"" and win the debate that way. Dismiss Pro's baseless claim. 8. Pro totally ignores my evidence that the Fed is NOT a private corporation, and that it IS limited by Congress in a manner similar to other federal agencies which make the majority of our laws. Pro has dropped this argument. 9. See 7 10. See 5 .",premise,con,,unknown,unknown
